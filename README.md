# 🎓 Result Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

This project showcases a comprehensive result analysis dashboard built using Tableau. It visualizes student performance across semesters and subjects, highlighting key insights like toppers, bottom performers, pass/fail trends, and backlog distribution.

## 📂 Project Overview

The data was originally scattered across **multiple PDF files** with inconsistent formatting. I consolidated all the relevant records into a **single Excel file**, performed **data cleaning and transformation**, and used **calculated fields** and **interactive filters** in Tableau to create meaningful visualizations.
